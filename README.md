Node-phantom-simple [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/apendua/node-phantom-simple.svg?branch=travis)](https://travis-ci.org/apendua/node-phantom-simple)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a bridge between [PhantomJs](http://phantomjs.org/) and
[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

This module is API compatible with node-phantom but doesn't rely on WebSockets
or socket.io. In essence the communication between Node and Phantom has been
made significantly simpler. It has the following advantages over node-phantom:

  - Fewer dependencies/layers.
  - Just uses the HTTP server module built into Node.
  - Doesn't use the unreliable and huge socket.io.
  - Works under `cluster` (node-phantom does not due to how `server.listen(0)`
    works in cluster)

Requirements
------------
You will need to install PhantomJS first. The bridge assumes that the
"phantomjs" binary is available in the PATH, or you will need to pass its path
into the `phantom.create() method.

For running the tests you will need [Expresso](http://visionmedia.github.com/expresso/).
The tests require PhantomJS 1.6 or newer to pass.

Installing
----------

    npm install node-phantom-simple


Usage
-----
You can use it exactly like you would use Node-Phantom, and the entire API of
PhantomJS should work, with the exception that every method call takes a
callback (always as the last parameter) instead of returning values.

For example this is an adaptation of a
[web scraping example](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/web-scraping-with-node-js/) :

```javascript
var phantom=require('node-phantom-simple');
phantom.create(function(err,ph) {
  return ph.createPage(function(err,page) {
    return page.open("http://tilomitra.com/repository/screenscrape/ajax.html", function(err,status) {
      console.log("opened site? ", status);
      page.includeJs('http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js', function(err) {
        //jQuery Loaded.
        //Wait for a bit for AJAX content to load on the page. Here, we are waiting 5 seconds.
        setTimeout(function() {
          return page.evaluate(function() {
            //Get what you want from the page using jQuery. A good way is to populate an object with all the jQuery commands that you need and then return the object.
            var h2Arr = [],
            pArr = [];
            $('h2').each(function() {
              h2Arr.push($(this).html());
            });
            $('p').each(function() {
              pArr.push($(this).html());
            });

            return {
              h2: h2Arr,
              p: pArr
            };
          }, function(err,result) {
            console.log(result);
            ph.exit();
          });
        }, 5000);
      });
	});
  });
});
```

### phantom.create(callback, options)

`options` is an optional object with options for how to start PhantomJS.
`options.parameters` is an array of parameters that will be passed to PhantomJS
on the commandline.

For example

```javascript
phantom.create(callback, {parameters: {'ignore-ssl-errors': 'yes'}})
```

will start phantom as:

```bash
phantomjs --ignore-ssl-errors=yes
```

You may also pass in a custom path if you need to select a specific instance
of PhantomJS or it is not present in PATH environment. This can for example
be used together with the [PhantomJS package](https://npmjs.org/package/phantomjs)
like so:

```javascript
phantom.create(callback, {phantomPath: require('phantomjs').path})
```

You can also have a look at the test folder to see some examples of using the
API, however the de-facto reference is the
[PhantomJS documentation](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/wiki/API-Reference).
Just change all return values into callbacks.

`options.ignoreErrorPattern` is a regular expression that can be used to silence spurious
warnings generated by qt and phantomjs.

On Mavericks, you can use: `{ignoreErrorPattern: /CoreText/}` to suppress some common annoying font-related warnings.

WebPage Callbacks
-----

All of the WebPage callbacks have been implemented including `onCallback`, and
are set the same way as with the core phantomjs library:

```javascript
page.onResourceReceived = function(response) {
    console.log('Response (#' + response.id + ', stage "' + response.stage + '"): ' + JSON.stringify(response));
};
```

This includes the `onPageCreated` callback which receives a new `page` object.

Properties
-----

Properties on the [WebPage](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/wiki/API-Reference-WebPage)
and [Phantom](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/wiki/API-Reference-phantom)
objects are accessed via the `get()/set()` method calls:

```javascript
page.get('content', function (err,html) {
  console.log("Page HTML is: " + html);
})
page.set('zoomfactor', 0.25, function () {
  page.render('capture.png');
})
```
